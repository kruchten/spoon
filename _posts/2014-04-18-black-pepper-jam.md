This is a very spicy and tart sauce to use with grilled meat: steak, or pork loin etc.

* 3 cups strawberries, cut in small chunks
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tbsp pectin crystals

## Preparation
1. Cook all this for some 15 minutes, or more; until it thickens a bit.
2. Pass in a blender for some 5-8 seconds
3. Put in small jars

### Notes
* First tasted in the *Fable restaurant* in Vancouver. Reversed-engineered on Mayne island a couple of week later.
* Tried also with peaches instead of strawberries.
