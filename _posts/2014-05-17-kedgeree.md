[Kedgeree][kd] is an anglo-indian breakfast dish made from yesterday night's rice leftovers. First tasted at a Montreal restaurant called Lawrence, although the Dominion Square Tavern also serves it (sans haddock) as a side-dish paired with grilled salmon.

## Ingredients

* day-old cooked rice (1/2 cup per person)
* eggs (2 per person)
* smoked haddock (1/2 tin per person)
* diced cherry or cocktail tomatoes (2 per person)
* curry powder
* lemon juice
* butter

## Steps

1. Get set up to have some soft-boiled eggs by the time you're done
2. Melt some butter in a pan and add curry powder and lemon juice until it's yellow and pasty
3. Add rice and break up the clumps, stirring until it gets soft and yellow

4. Add tomatoes and haddock (break haddock into chunks) and warm them without cooking them (basically turn the heat off and stir them in)
5. Serve, with shelled soft-boiled eggs
