## Ingredients
* 2 cups flour
* 2tsp baking powder
* 1/4tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup butter (very cold)
* 3/4 cup milk (very cold)

## Preparation
1. Heat oven to 425 degrees.  
2. Mix/sift all dry ingredients together.   
3. Cut in the butter, using your hands or a pastry cutter. If using your hands, work quickly to avoid melting the butter.  
4. When the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs, add the milk and mix until *just* combined.  
5. Remove from bowl and place onto floured countertop - do not worry that the mixture doesn't hold together yet.  
6. Flatten the mixture into a rectangle, fold into thirds, then turn 90 degrees.  Repeat three more times, incorporating crumbs/flour as you go.  
7. Flatten out dough with a rolling pin and cut out roughly 12-16 biscuits using a glass.   
8. Bake until golden brown.

### Note
This recipe is pretty flexible, and you can substitute lots of the ingredients or add some in too - i.e. cheese, herbs, spices, etc.
