Moussaka is essentially about eggplant. It is a Greek oven dish that combines layers of ground meat, fried or baked eggplant, and a béchamel sauce on top.

It's rather long to prepare from scratch: some preliminary cooking, before assembling (50-55 minutes of work), then some oven cooking just before serving (40 minutes, but no work) ; or you can do the prep work and assembly around breakfast, lave the assembly in gthe fridge, and do the final cooking just before dinner.

There are many variants and options: sweat the eggplant or not, kind of meat: lamb, mutton, pork, ..., potatoes or no potatoes (for a more nutritious dish), types of spices, etc.
