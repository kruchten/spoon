## Ingredients
* 1 cup semolina flour
* 1 cup white flour
* 3 eggs
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon olive oil

## Preparation
1. Mix all wet ingredients together and all dry ingredients together.  
* Add the wet ingredients to the dry. The dough should be stiff but workable.  
* Knead for about 10 minutes, then place to rest for 20 minutes, wrapped in plastic wrap.
* Divide the dough into 4 parts, then run through the pasta machine.  
* In the pasta machine, run through on setting 1 twice, then fold (in the short direction) and run through twice again.  
* Run through settings 2 to 6 twice each. Use the "cutting" setting to cut into noodles.   
* When each batch is done, hang over a wooden spoon set between two chairs (or similar).   
* When all the pasta is done, boil until cooked then serve!
