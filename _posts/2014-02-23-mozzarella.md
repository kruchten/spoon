##Ingredients
* 4 litres of milk (min. 2%)†
* 1/2 pack thermophilic culture†† 
* 1/2 tsp rennet
* 1/8 tsp lipase (mild)
* 150 g salt (for the brine)
* thermometer (0-100°C)
* kitchen gloves for the kneading

##Preparation
1. Heat milk to 32°C (90°F) on medium heat
2. Dissolve thermophilic culture and lipase in a bit of water
3. Add this to the warm milk, stir well, cover
4. Let rest for 30+ minutes
5. Dissolve the rennet in a bit of water
6. Add rennet to milk, stir well, cover

7. Let the curd form, for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour. It should look like one massive blob of smooth tofu. Should give a "clean break" if you dip a finger in it and lift it:

8. Cut the curds in 1.5 cm blobs with a big knife, first in one direction, then 90 across, then across the height.
9. Let rest for 15 minutes

10. Heat (very low) the curds to 38°C (100°F), while slowly stirring constantly
11. Let rest, covered, for 5 minutes
12. Drain the whey from the curds‡

13. Keep the pot with the curds in a hot bath in the sink at about 40°C (104°F)

14. For 2 1/2 hour, drain off once in a while the whey and flip the curds over
15. Put the curds in 75°C (190°F) water, with a strainer. Let them warm up. Take half of them out.
15. Separate the curds in small chunks (2 cm), and then knead them with your hands (gloved, it's hot); do the other half; this take 5 to 15 minutes.

17. Wait at least an hour in the brine.
18. Now it is ready to use.

###Notes:
† Non-homogenized whole milk at 3.25% or more is best. Whole goat milk is good too; it produces a drier cheese. (Should we then put more salt and call it "feta"?)  
†† Thermophilic culture = Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus (it is similar to what is used to make natural yogurt)   
‡ The whey is good; you can drink some, use it in soup, etc... or make ricotta (a spoonful or two)   
The yield is approx. 480 g of cheese for 4 litres of milk; that's 3.5 litres of whey!
With goat milk however, the ricotta is richer, smoother and more abundant.
