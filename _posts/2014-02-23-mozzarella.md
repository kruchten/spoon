7. Let the curd form, for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour. It should look like one massive blob of smooth tofu. Should give a "clean break":

13. Keep the pot with the curds in a hot bath in the sink at about 40°C (104°F)
14. For 2 1/2 hour, drain off once in a while the whey and flip the curds over
15. Put the curds in 75°C (190°F) water, with a strainer. Take half of them out.
15. Separate the curds in small chunks (2 cm), and then knead them with your hands (gloved?); this take 5 to 15 minutes

###Notes:
†Thermophilic culture = Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus (similar to what is used to make yogurt)   
††The whey is good; you can drink some, use it in soup, etc... or make ricotta (a spoonful)
