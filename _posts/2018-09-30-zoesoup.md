5. Add you broth (the water and bouillon can be dissolved beforehand) and the lentils, bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 25min
6. Blitz everything with an immersion blender or standing blender
7. Stir in the miso paste (dissolve it first in some warm water)

### Notes

* Adapted from here: http://laurencariscooks.com/mushroom-lentil-soup-miso/
* 1.5L makes for a very liquidy soup. Cut the water by 1/3 for a thicker soup, or discard some of the liquid before blending.
