This recipe was inspired by the *Tartine Bread* (Chad Roberston, in SFO), as described in Michael Pollan's book *Cooked* (2013), appendix 3: "Whole wheat country loaf". The main differences are:  
* Pollan has a 92% hydration level, which I found is way too liquid for me; mine is about 77%  
* I bake my loaves on a stone, with steam for the first 10 minutes, not in a Dutch oven.   

##Ingredients
For the leaven (in French: levain):  

* 150 g of sourdough starter culture   
* 200 g white wheat flour   
* 200 g water   

Then for the soaker:  
 
* 600 g of whole wheat flour   
* 150 g of whole rye flour   
* 700 g of water   

Then for the main build:   

* 200 g of leaven (above)   
* 1450 g of soaked whole flour (above)  
* 250 g of white flour     
* 23 g of salt (approx 4 tsp)   
* 50 g of water  
* 5 g of yeast (1 tsp)   

##Instructions
The night before:  

1. Prepare a leaven with 100 to 150 g of your best culture, mixed with 200 g of white flour and 200 g of water. Cover and let rest in warm area (20°C)

2. Soak 600g of whole wheat flour and 150 g of whole rye flour with 700 g of water. This process, called *autolysis*, will soften the bran, break down the hardest cells and develop the flavours. Let both rest overnight (approx. 12 hours). 
 
Then the next day:  

3. Test the leaven; it should float on water, like this:

4. Dissolve a tsp (5 g) of yeast in 50 g of lukewarm water.   
5. Assemble: 200 g of leaven (levain), the 1,450 g of soaked flour, 250 g of white flour, and the yeast.  
6. Mix thouroughly; let rest of 30 minutes.   
7. Sprinkle the salt and mix again thouroughly. Cover with a plastic film.   
8. Let it ferment and rise for 3 to 4 hours at 25°C (I use the oven with the light on)   
9. Every 30 to 40 minutes, stretch and fold the dough 3 or 4 times. Use a wet hand, slip it under the mass of dough, stretch it up, and fold; turn the bowl, etc.   
10. On a generously floured surface, cut the dough in 3 and form 3 globes.    
11. Let them rest of 20 minutes.     
12. Shape the loaves; round or sighly elongated.  
13. Put each loaf in a bowl lined with a linen towel generously floured.   
14. Let them proof in a warm spot for 2 to 3 hours at 25°C (oven with light on, again).

15. Drop the loaves on parchment paper. Score with a razor blade.    
16. Bake them for 40 minutes at 500°F (260°C) with steam for the first 10 minutes.

###Notes
No, Alice, do not throw cold water on a 500°F (260°C) hot Pyrex dish.
