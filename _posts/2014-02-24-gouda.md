## Ingredients
* 8 liters whole milk (3.25% fat or more), __not__ homogenized !
* 1/4 tsp mesophilic culture
* 1/2 tsp calcium chloride
* 1/2 tsp rennet   
For brine:       
* 2 liters water   
* 360 g salt   

## Equipment
* large metallic pot
* thermometer
* butter muslin (or cheesecloth)
* Dutch press
* 13 cm hoop + follower
* wax

## Preparation
1. Put all the milk in a large pot ( at t0)
2. Heat milk slowly to 29°C-32°C, stirring once in a while (t+5')
2. Dilute the bacterial culture, the calcium chloride, and the rennet, separately in quarter cups of lukewwarm water.

3. Add the bacterial culture, and stir (t+35')  
3. Let rest for 30 minutes
4. Add the calcium chloride, stir (t+1h05')
5. Add the rennet, and stir well with a skimmer.
6. Cover and let rest for 40 to 45 minutes at 29°C+ 
7. Check for clean break; wait maybe another 15 minutes if not ready (t+1h40)
8. Curd curd in cubes about 1 cm with a big knife
9. Let stand for 5 minutes
9. Stir curds for 5 minutes, then let them settle down for 5 minutes (t+2h10)
10. Heat 2 liters of water to 60°C
11. Remove 3 cups of whey from the top
12. Replace with 3 cups of water at 60°C to reach 33°C-35°C
13. Stir for 10 minutes, then let settle
14. Replace 1/3 of the volume of the whey, with same amount of water at 43°C to reach 37°C-39°C (that is 10 cups)
15. Stir for 20 minutes, occasionaly, breaking big lumps of curd, then let settle for 10 min.
16. Line the hoop with the wet butter muslin (or cheesecloth)
17. Drain most of the whey (t+3h15) 
18. Transfer all the curds in the hoop; fold the muslin on top 
19. Put the follower on top of the hoop and in the press, and apply light pressure for 30 minutes (1 brick x4)  (t+3h50)

20. Re-dress the cheese, and put back in press with higher pressure for 30 minutes (2 bricks x4)  (t+4h25)  
21. Prepare a saturated brine at 18% (that is, 360 g of salt for 2 liters of water)   
22. Re-dress the cheese, and put back in press with higher pressure for 8 to 12 hours (4 bricks x4)  (t+4h45).   
22. Unwrap cheese and place in brine for 8 to 12 hours, turning over a few times.  
23. Let cheese dry on a mat for 2 or 3 days at room temperature, turning over daily

24. Ripen cheese at 10°C to 12°C for 1 week, flipping it over once or twice a day
25. Coat with wax

26. Ripen at 12°C for 8 to 100 weeks, turning over weekly.

### Notes   
* Mesophilic culture: Lactococcus lactis *subspecies* lactis + Lactococcus lactis *subspecies* cremoris + Lactococcus lactis *subspecies biovar* diacetylactis, such as in Danisco’s DVS Choozit MM100 or MM101 or BT002. Alternatively, Biena's Aroma B adds some Leuconostoc mesenteroides *subspecies* cremoris.      
* Pressure: hoop ∅ 4.5" => 16 sq in; 1 brick = 2.4 kg multiplied by 4 by lever => 1.32 psi; 2 bricks => 2.64 psi, 4 bricks => 5.28 psi etc   
* Yield: 8 liters of milk yield about 1 kg of cheese   
* Fat: as 8 liters of milk at 3.25% contain 260 g of fat, the cheese is 26% fat, or a bit less as some of the fat floats away in the discarded whey.
