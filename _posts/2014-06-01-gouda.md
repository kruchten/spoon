## Ingredients
* 8 liters whole milk (3.25%), not homogenized
* 1/4 tsp mesophilic culture
* 1/2 tsp calcium chloride
* 1/2 tsp rennet   

For brine:  
 
* 2 liters water  
* 360 g salt  

## Equipment
* large metallic pot
* thermometer
* cheese cloth
* Dutch press
* 13 cm mold
* wax

## Preparation
1. Heat milk slowly to 29°C-32°C, stirring once in a while
2. Dilute culture in quarter cup of warm water, add, and stir
3. Let rest for 30 minutes
4. Dilute calcium chloride in quarter cup of water, add, stir
5. Dilute rennet in quarter cup of water, add, stir well
6. Cover and let rest for 30 to 45 minutes at 29°C
7. Check for clean break (wait maybe another 15 min.)
8. Curd curd in cubes about 1 cm
9. Let stand for 5 minutes
9. Stir curd for 5 minutes, then let rest for 5 minutes
10. Heat 2 liters of water to 60°C
11. Remove 6 cups of whey
12. Replace with 6 cups of water at 60°C to reach 33°C-35°C
13. Stir for 10 min., then let settle
14. Replace 1/3 of the volume of the whey, with same amount of water at 43°C to reach 37°C-39°C
15. Stir for 20 minutes, then let settle for 10 min.
16. Preapre cheesecloth in mould
17. Drain most of the whey 
18. Transfer all the curd in the mould
19. Put the mould in the press, and apply light pressure for 30 minutes (1 brick x 4) ![image](img/gouda2.jpg) 
20. Re-dress the cheese, and put back in press with higher pressure for 8 to 12 hours (2 bricks x 4)
21. Prepare a saturated brine at 18% (that is, 360 g of salt for 2 liters of water)
22. Unwrap cheese and place in brine for 12 hours, turning over a few times.
23. Let cheese dry on a mat for 2 or 3 days at room temperature, turning over daily
24. Ripen cheese at 10°C to 12°C for 1 week
25. Coat with wax
26. Ripen at 12°C for 8 to 100 weeks, turning over weekly.

  

### Notes   
Mesophilic culture: Lactococcus lactis *subspecies* lactis + Lactococcus lactis *subspecies* cremoris + Lactococcus lactis *subspecies biovar* diacetylactis, such as in Danisco’s DVS Choozit MM100 or MM101 or BT002. Or   
Pressure: hoop ∅ 4.5" => 16 sq in; 1 brick = 3.6 kg multiplied by 4 by lever => 2 psi; 2 bricks => 4 psi   
Yield: 8 liters of milk yield about 1 kg of cheese; as 8 liters of milk at 3.25% contain 260 g of fat, the cheese is 26% fat, or a bit less as some of the fat floats away in the discarded whey.
