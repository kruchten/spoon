* 1/4 tsp mesophilic culture
* 1/2 tsp calcium chloride
* 1/2 tsp rennet   

For brine:  
 
* 2 liters water  
* 360 g salt  

## Equipment
* large metallic pot
* thermometer
* cheese cloth
* Dutch press
* 13 cm mold
* wax

## Preparation
1. Heat milk to 29°C-32°C
2. Dilute culture in warm water, add, and stir
3. Let rest for 30 min
4. Dilute calcium chloride in warm water, add, stir
5. Dilute rennet in warm water, add, stir
6. Cover and let rest for 30 to 45 min. at 29°C
7. Check for clean break
8. Curd curd in cubes about 1 cm
9. Let stand for 5 min
9. Stir curd for 5 min, then let rest for 5 minutes
10. Heat 4-5 cups of water to 60°C
11. Remove 6 cups of whey
12. Replace with 6 cups of water at 60°C to reach 33°C-35°C
13. Stir for 10 min., then let settle
14. Replace 1/3 of the volume of the whey, with same amount of water at 43°C to reach 37°C-39°C
15. Stir for 20 min., then let settle for 10 min.
16. Preapre cheesecloth in mould
17. Drain most of the whey 
18. Transfer all the curd in the mould
19. Put the mould in the press, and apply light pressure for 30 minutes (1 brick x 4)
20. Re-dress the cheese, and put back in press with higher pressure for 8 to 12 hours (2 bricks x 4)
21. Prepare a saturated brine, 18% (360 g of salt for 2 liters of water)
22. Unwrap cheese and place in brine for 12 hours, turning over after 6.
23. Let cheese dry of a mat for 2 or 3 days at room temperature, turning over daily

### Notes
Mesophilic culture: Lactococcus lactis *subspecies* lactis + Lactococcus lactis *subspecies* cremoris + Lactococcus lactis *subspecies biovar* diacetylactis, such as in  manufacturer Danisco’s DVS Choozit MM100 or MM101 or BT002.   
Pressure:    
Yield: 8 liters of milk yield about 1 kg of cheese; as 8 liters of milk at 3.25% contain 260 g of fat, the cheese is 26% fat, or a bit less as some of the fat floats away in the discarded whey.
